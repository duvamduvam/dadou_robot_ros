# Hardware Overview

## Physical Specification
- Weight: ~50 kg wood & metal frame
- Mobility: two driven wheels, stabilised by the controller commands
- Upper body: two arms (no hands) with servo actuation
- Head: LED strips for eyes and a removable LED mouth
- Power: ensure the battery/PSU setup is documented in the operations sheet (add details as they evolve)

## Sensors & Inputs
- Serial-connected glove (RP2040) that translates performer gestures
- Optional onboard sensors (I2C accelerometer, etc.) configured through `robot_config.py`

## Devices
All motors are driven by an I2C PCA9685 PWM board attached to the Raspberry Pi 4, reducing wiring complexity and electrical load on the Pi.

The I2C signal from the Pi is isolated with an ISO1540 STEMMA bidirectional isolator to protect the main board.

### Wheels differential drive

The PWM signal feeds a Cytron SmartDrive 40 A motor driver (10–45 V) that powers the wheel motors.

Each wheel uses a 250 W brushless cycle motor.

### Arms, eyes and mouth servos
The arms and mouth are controlled by ASME-MR 380 kg·cm continuous-rotation RC servos.

The eyes use a JX Servo CLS-12V7346 (46 kg·cm, 12 V).

### Power supply
The battery pack is built from 18650 cells rated at 40 C (8×5 configuration, capacity to be confirmed).

A Daly Smart BMS (Li-ion, 7S/8S/16S capable) manages charging and 24 V output for the high-power domain.

12 V is generated by a Mean Well SD-50B-24 DC/DC converter.

5 V is generated by a second Mean Well SD-50B-24 configured for 5 V output.

## Electronics board
Document diagrams, pinouts, and maintenance procedures here. Include photos or links under `docs/hardware/assets/` as they become available.
The main distribution board interfaces the Raspberry Pi with the PWM drivers, LED strips, and matrix through 74AHCT125 level shifters.

The audio board manages relays to switch audio sources between wireless receivers and the Raspberry Pi, while also distributing 9 V power to the audio devices.

## Maintenance Checklist
- Inspect cabling before each performance
- Verify servo calibration after transport
- Confirm LED strips are firmly attached and diffused correctly for stage lighting
- Test emergency stop procedures (describe them in `docs/operations.md`)
